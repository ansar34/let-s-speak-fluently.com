      <h1>How to improve English speaking?</h1>
      <p>According to my point of view that if you want to improve English speaking so that listen more and more as you can. If I give to you one example when we were kids. We were listening to our mother, father and sister so that listening entered to our mind and we became able to speak.
        Listen motivational speeches,  Islamic videos, English movies, Song etcetera then after sometime you will be able to speak like a native. 
        Believe me I was not able to understand speaking of native. Now I can speak like a native because of listening.  
        My suggestion to you is to listen.
        This is easy way to improve English speaking. So the more you listen the more you will speak like a native.
        
        
        
        A good listener is a good speaker.
        A good reader is a good writer.
        2: Second point is to learn more vocabulary. Vocabulary will help you to speak good.
        
        Thank you for reading.
