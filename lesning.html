<h1>How to improve English listening?</h1>
<p>Listening is much more essential to learn English speaking. As beginner  we can't understand English song, movies or motivational speeches. In song, movies or speeches the native speaker pronounce complete sentence as one word. How? I will give you one example.  This sentence "Have a good day". There is four word but native speaker pronounce as on word like "Havagooday". And more like sometime they do not pronounce the word "T" like "want" pronounce as "wan". There are many role for speaking like       1: If the vowels come before word "r" so the "r" is silent here.    2: If the word end with consonant and next word start with consonant so we have to join to words and pronounce like one example "good day" is pronounce like "gooday".  3: Weak form are those like "for, you, to etc." are pronounce like "fa, ya, ta". There are many roles Now I can't explain in text much more better so in this website there is video tutorial I explained there in better way.<br>
